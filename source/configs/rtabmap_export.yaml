  # Primary Output Settings
  # This voxel size determines the resolution of 'scene.ply' which is used by YOLO and Mask3D.
  # Smaller = Higher Resolution (more points), Larger = Faster / Less Memory.
  # Recommended: 0.02 (2cm) for high quality, 0.05 (5cm) for speed/memory safety.

  # Max points to sample (Prevent massive files)

  # Axis Correction
  # Transform from RTAB-Map (Optical: Z-Forward) to Pipeline (OpenGL: Z-Backward)
  # Diag(1, -1, -1, 1): Keeps X (Right), Flips Y (Up), Flips Z (Backward)
